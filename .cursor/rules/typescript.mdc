### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleSubmit)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer types over interfaces
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference
- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation
- Create type guards for runtime value validation using `value is Type` syntax
- Implement type guards for enum-like values and complex object validation
- Use type guards in repository layers and API boundaries for data integrity
- Combine type guards with early returns for clean validation flow
- avoid using `as` casts unless absolutely necessary
